- **Nested Structures**: Easily create parent-child relationships with proper nesting
- **Real-time Preview**: See your XML structure update in real-time as you build
- **Drag & Drop Reordering**: Rearrange elements with simple up/down controls
- **Collapsible Elements**: Toggle visibility of complex nested structures
- **Copy to Clipboard**: Export your finished XML with one click

## 🛠️ How to Use
