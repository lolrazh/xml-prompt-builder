# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This specification defines the requirements for creating comprehensive documentation of the XML Prompt Builder codebase. The XML Prompt Builder is a full-stack web application that allows users to visually create, edit, and manage structured XML prompts for AI systems. The application features a React frontend with TypeScript, a Cloudflare Workers backend using Hono, and Better Auth for authentication with OAuth providers.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer joining the project, I want comprehensive documentation of the codebase architecture, so that I can quickly understand the system structure and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing the documentation THEN the system SHALL provide a complete overview of the application architecture including frontend, backend, and database components
2. WHEN examining the documentation THEN the system SHALL describe the technology stack with specific versions and dependencies
3. WHEN reading the documentation THEN the system SHALL explain the project structure with clear directory organization and file purposes
4. WHEN studying the documentation THEN the system SHALL include deployment architecture details for both development and production environments

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want detailed documentation of all API endpoints and data models, so that I can understand the backend functionality and integrate with it properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing API documentation THEN the system SHALL document all REST endpoints with HTTP methods, paths, request/response schemas, and authentication requirements
2. WHEN examining data models THEN the system SHALL provide complete database schema documentation including table structures, relationships, and constraints
3. WHEN studying authentication THEN the system SHALL document the Better Auth implementation with OAuth provider configurations and session management
4. WHEN reviewing backend logic THEN the system SHALL explain the Cloudflare Workers environment setup and deployment process

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a frontend developer, I want comprehensive documentation of React components and their interactions, so that I can understand the UI architecture and modify components safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN examining component documentation THEN the system SHALL document all React components with their props, state, and lifecycle methods
2. WHEN reviewing UI architecture THEN the system SHALL explain the component hierarchy and data flow patterns
3. WHEN studying state management THEN the system SHALL document React Query usage, local storage patterns, and authentication state handling
4. WHEN examining styling THEN the system SHALL document the Tailwind CSS configuration and custom styling patterns

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation of the core XML building functionality, so that I can understand and extend the visual XML editor features.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing XML functionality THEN the system SHALL document the XMLElement data structure and its properties
2. WHEN examining editor features THEN the system SHALL explain element creation, editing, nesting, reordering, and deletion operations
3. WHEN studying XML generation THEN the system SHALL document the algorithm for converting visual elements to formatted XML output
4. WHEN reviewing import/export THEN the system SHALL explain the XML parsing logic and file handling capabilities

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation of development workflows and best practices, so that I can set up the development environment and follow project conventions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up development THEN the system SHALL provide complete setup instructions for both frontend and backend environments
2. WHEN following development practices THEN the system SHALL document coding standards, naming conventions, and project structure guidelines
3. WHEN deploying the application THEN the system SHALL provide deployment instructions for both development and production environments
4. WHEN contributing to the project THEN the system SHALL document the git workflow, testing procedures, and code review process

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want documentation of security considerations and performance optimizations, so that I can maintain and improve the application safely.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN reviewing security THEN the system SHALL document authentication flows, CORS configuration, and data validation patterns
2. WHEN examining performance THEN the system SHALL explain optimization strategies including lazy loading, caching, and bundle optimization
3. WHEN studying error handling THEN the system SHALL document error boundaries, API error handling, and user feedback mechanisms
4. WHEN reviewing monitoring THEN the system SHALL explain logging patterns and debugging strategies for both frontend and backend
